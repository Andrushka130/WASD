# WASD

## About
**WASD** is a simple game developed in C# with Unity and influenced by Brotato, Vampire Survivor. This project was made for our module "Software Development 3" in the third semester of BSc Medieninformatik at Hochschule der Medien. <br>

**WASD** is a Rogue-Like, Auto-Shooter, Survial game played in a Cyberpunk world and created in pixel-art. <br>

Our game stands out with simplicity in gameplay and our varierty of items and weapons combinations. You are playing an "Mercenary" called "hier k√∂nnte ihr Werbung stehen". She is able to handle up to 6 weapons at the same time and she gets continuous upgrades through items, like implementable Brainsystem or Inner Eye.<br>

**BUT** watch out if you substitute to much of your human body you will go insane and turn into a Cyberpsycho. <br>
Your **goal** is to survive all enemy waves as long as you can to get the best highscore among all players. <br>
